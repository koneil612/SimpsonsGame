<p>Who doesn't love a good zombie game? Add the Simpson's and you have WHAT</p>

<p>You are Chief Wiggum trying to save Springfield from the zombies. Play using your arrow keys, and clear the board prior to time running out or getting attacked. You can flip Wiggum by hitting enter and you shoot using the space bar. 

Log in and you can pick up where you left off prior. - That's assuming you are still alive.

The game is using javascript and canvas. PostgreSQL is holding the database information for us. With JQuery touches to make it run smoother.
